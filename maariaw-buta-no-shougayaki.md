# Buta no Shougayaki aka Ginger Pork

## Ingredients

### Preparing the meat
- 400g thinly sliced pork loin
- 1 tbsp flour
- salt
- pepper
- oil for the pan

### Ginger sauce
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1-2 tbsp mirin
- 1-2 tbsp sake
- ½ tbsp grated ginger
- ½ tbsp grated garlic

### To serve with
- thinly sliced cabbage
- freshly cooked rice

## Steps

1. Spread your pork slices on a cutting board or a similar surface
2. With scissors, make small cuts in your pork slices, especially if they have fatty streaks. This will prevent the slices from shrinking and curling too much when cooking.
3. Use a small sieve (like a tea seave) to sprinkle a thin dusting of flour on the pork slices. Then season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Turn the slices and repeat step 3.
5. Mix the ingredients for the ginger sauce
6. Preheat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Depending on how fatty or lean your pork is, add vegetable oil.
7. Add the pork slices in a single layer and fry until the bottom is golden brown, then flip the slices and cook the other side similarly.
8. Add the ginger sauce. If all your pork doesn't fit in the pan at once, divide your sauce accordingly.
9. Mix the sauce and the pork in the pan, until the sauce is thick enough to at least partly stick to the slices.
10. Serve over rice, be sure to get all that delicious sauce from the pan! Thinly sliced cabbage goes well with this dish.
